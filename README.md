# 🧠 Codewars Kata Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding challenges (katas) on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).  
I'm using this repo to practice clean code, improve problem-solving skills, and track my progress.

## 🗂️ Structure

Solutions are organized by **language** and **difficulty level (Kyu)**:

## About Kyu Levels

Codewars uses **Kyu** ranks to indicate difficulty:  
- **8 Kyu** = easiest (beginner level)  
- Lower numbers = harder challenges  

This repo starts from 8 Kyu and progresses toward more difficult problems.
